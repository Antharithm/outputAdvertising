# Back at VeloJawn: A Night of Philly Fusion

## Round Two at First Fridays

After a stellar performance at VeloJawn's First Friday series in February that nearly packed the house, Expansion Project is thrilled to announce their return to the venue on March 7th, 2025. The trio will once again headline the evening, joined by Philadelphia's own funk-soul-jazz fusion outfit, The Sermon!

&nbsp;

### Building Momentum

This marks Expansion Project's second show of 2025, building on the momentum from last month's near-sellout performance. The combination of these two innovative Philly bands promises an unforgettable night of groove-heavy fusion and improvisational mastery.

&nbsp;

### For Fans Of

If you're a fan of groundbreaking artists like Moses Yoofee Trio, Yussef Dayes, Snarky Puppy, or Domi and JD Beck, this show is tailor-made for you. Both bands share that same spirit of pushing musical boundaries while keeping the groove firmly intact.
