# Expansion Project Kicks Off 2025 with First Fridays

## The Return to Live Music

After a brief winter hiatus, Expansion Project is thrilled to announce their first performance of 2025! The band will be taking the stage at "First Fridays" on February 7th, 2025, marking the beginning of what promises to be an exciting year of live music and artistic exploration.

### First Fridays: A Cultural Celebration

First Fridays has become a cornerstone of Philadelphia's cultural scene, bringing together music, food, and community in a monthly celebration of artistic expression. This February edition promises to be particularly special as Expansion Project brings their unique blend of funk, jazz, and progressive fusion to the stage.
